üöÄ Full-Stack Flashcard Application
A secure, multi-component web application for creating, managing, and studying user-owned flashcard decks. This project demonstrates full-stack proficiency across the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

‚ú® Key Features
Complete Authentication: User registration, login, and token-based session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Deck Management (CRUD): Users can create, view, modify (not implemented), and delete their own flashcard decks.

Card Management (CRUD): Users can add, view, and delete individual flashcards within any of their decks.

Interactive Study View: A core feature allowing users to cycle through cards, flip them to reveal answers, and track session progress.

Protected Routes: All deck and card API endpoints are secured by custom JWT middleware.

Data Integrity: Implemented Cascade Delete logic to automatically remove all associated cards when a deck is deleted.

Modern UI: Clean, minimalist styling using a soft, deep purple color palette.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, you must have Node.js installed and a MongoDB Atlas account for database access.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
cd full-stack-MERN-flashcard-application
2. Back-End Setup (flashcard-app folder)
Navigate to the back-end directory:

Bash

cd flashcard-app
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Create a file named .env in the flashcard-app directory and add your secret variables:

Code snippet

# Get this URI from your MongoDB Atlas cluster
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>/flashcard-app?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# A random, long string for token security
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here 

# Port for the API
PORT=5000
Start the Node.js server:

Bash

node server.js
3. Front-End Setup (client folder)
Navigate back to the root, then into the client directory:

Bash

cd ..
cd client
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Start the React development server:

Bash

npm start
The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000, connecting to the API running on port 5000.

üí° Usage
Register: Create a new account via the /register route.

Login: Log in to receive your JWT.

Dashboard: On /dashboard, click the + Create New Deck button.

Study: Click Study Deck to enter the interactive study session and test yourself!
